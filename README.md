## **How to Fix:**

1. **Pull the remote changes and merge them:**
   ```sh
   git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```

2. **If there are any merge conflicts, resolve them (usually just in README.md).**
   - Open the conflicted file(s), choose which content to keep, save, and then:
     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
     ```

3. **Now push again:**
   ```sh
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

**After this, your code will be on GitHub and you can deploy to Vercel!**

If you get any merge conflict messages, copy them here and I’ll help you resolve them step by step.
